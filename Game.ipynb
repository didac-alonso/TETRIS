    "\n",
    "* The game is played on a rectangular board with fixed width and height.\n",
    "* A sequence of rectangular blocks must be placed on the board. The blocks cannot be rotated.\n",
    "* Every block can be placed anywhere on the board as long as the space is not occupied.\n",

    "In this project, you will have to implement an [online algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) for the Block Puzzle. The algorithm will read a sequence of blocks, i.e. ($w$,$h$)-pairs representing rectangles, and will place them on the board. Since the algorithm must be _online_, the location for each block must be computed without knowing the following blocks in the sequence.\n",
