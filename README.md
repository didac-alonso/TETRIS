# TETRIS

Data science first project

Language: Python

The game is an easy version of tetris, is based on 3 files, gameboard.py, myplayer.py and game.py.

The game is not thought to be played by humans, it's for the computer, myplayer.py contains the IA. The first version of the IA consists in place the block in the lowest possible square. In the future I'll add an "expert" IA which is able to survive 2 or 3 times more than the basic one.
